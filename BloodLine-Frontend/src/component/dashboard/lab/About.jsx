          <h2 className="about-section-title">Inspiration & Problem Statement</h2>
          <p className="about-section-paragraph">
            BloodLink was inspired by the long, exhausting wait times experienced at hospitals for routine blood checks. Patients often arrive early but still spend hours waiting in line, sometimes while feeling unwell. This inefficiency sparked the idea to create a system that reduces waiting times and streamlines patient flow, improving the overall healthcare experience.

          <h2 className="about-section-title">Challenges</h2>
          <p className="about-section-paragraph">
            Managing data flow between deeply nested React components was a key challenge. Through learning props, lifting state up, and implementing React Context for global state management, I enhanced the frontendâ€™s maintainability and user experience.

          <h2 className="about-section-title">Real-World Use & Future Plans</h2>
          <p className="about-section-paragraph">
            BloodLink holds strong potential for government hospital adoption but requires further development such as detailed workflow studies, stronger data security, scalability improvements, and regulatory compliance. My future vision includes integrating AI to automate triage, predict blood supply needs, assist doctors with decision-making, and provide real-time patient support, making BloodLink a proactive healthcare platform.

          <h2 className="about-section-title">Lessons Learned</h2>
          <p className="about-section-paragraph">
            This project taught me that technology can make a significant impact even in places where systems are traditionally basic and outdated. Creating practical, locally relevant solutions is as important as applying advanced tech. BloodLink is a step toward modernizing healthcare in Sri Lanka and beyond.
