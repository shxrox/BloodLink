# BloodLink 

## Project Reflection: Inspiration & Problem Statement

Every time I had to visit the hospital for routine blood tests, I had to get there as early as 7:30 AM just to stand in line. Even then, I often wouldnâ€™t finish until the afternoon â€” sometimes 2 or 3 PM. Waiting in those long queues, especially when youâ€™re not feeling well, was really exhausting and frustrating. Thatâ€™s when I thought: there has to be a better way. This experience inspired me to build BloodLink, a system designed to cut down waiting times and make the whole process smoother and less stressful for patients.
